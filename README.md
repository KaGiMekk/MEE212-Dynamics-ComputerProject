# MEE 212: Computer Project

## Overview
This project is designed by an engineering student from one of the top universities in Thailand. The aim is to demonstrate superb intellectual ability by designing a mechanical gun simulation that functions on a horizontal plane.

## Specifications
- The mechanical gun consists of a uniform rod AB with negligible mass and a sliding collar C with mass `m`.
- The rod is rotated by a motor providing a constant torque `T`.
- The collar slides on the smooth rod without friction.
- The system parameters are: `T = 1 N.m`, `l = 1 m`, `m = 1 kg`.

## Tasks
1. **Free Body Diagram (FBD):** Create FBDs for the collar alone.
2. **Equations of Motion:** Derive two equations of motion for the collar using the FBDs, accounting for both angular and radial motions.
3. **Code Development:** Write a computer program to compute the collar's position as a function of time.
4. **Visualization:** Generate plots for `R(t)` and `θ(t)` vs. time, and `R(θ)` in polar coordinates.
5. **Analysis:** Analyze the angle of the rod and the velocity of the collar at release, plotting `θ_shot` vs. `T` and `v_shot` vs. `T`.
6. **Discussion:** Thoroughly discuss the physics of the mechanical gun based on the generated plots.

## Getting Started
